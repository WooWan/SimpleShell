**history**

## important
>I implement my program based on document, but there is no guideline for history redundancy. So, in this part, I made my program based on Linux command
>Accoding to Linux command, continuous redundant commands are not be added in history.

Print out all commands that have been entered by the user along with the command numbers since the shell was invoked.
